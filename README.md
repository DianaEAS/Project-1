#Issues and Bugs 

The developer ran into several issues during the development of the website, mainly the ones listed below, along with solutions or ideas to implement in the future. 

  

Responsiveness - In his first attempt at styling the web page, the developer started with a phone-sized screen. She found this approach useful, because most of the target users will access the site on their phones. However, when validating the site in the desktop-sized screen, some of the images and font sizes seem to be too big or too small. It was overcome by creating the right displays and correcting the margins and the width percentages and proportions.  

Deprecated frameborder attribute on the iframe element Bug - When copying the embed code from a YouTube video, the code contains a deprecated attribute frameborder. The HTML validator pointed out this issue and the code the attribute was omitted.  

  
Characters missing or misplaced semicolons - There were bugs in the iframe and images where they were not terminated by a semicolon or it was written outside of the style, after the quotation marks. 

The Nomads file was created using a capital, which made in unable to display online. Once that initial letter was changed using 
github, it was properly shown.
